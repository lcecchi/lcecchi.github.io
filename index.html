	<p>Hello! &#128512; I am a second year PhD student in Geometry and Mathematical Physics at <a href="https://www.sissa.it/">SISSA</a>. Here is my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>. I am currently working on Wasserstein distances on geometric spaces (e.g. moduli spaces of algebraic hypersurfaces) induced by optimal transport, under the supervision of prof. Antonio Lerario.</p>
	<p>Other things that I like:
		<ul><li>Infinite dimensional manifolds</li>
		<li>Music/singing</li>
		<li>(Algebraic) topology</li>
		<li>Playing sports &#9917; &#127955; &#127952;</li>
		<li>Universal properties</li>
		<li>Geek stuff & games</li>
		<li>"Contravariant" geometry (e.g. pointless topology, C*-algebras...)</li></ul></p>

		<p>In my Masters' thesis (under prof. Valentino Magnani) I studied Fr&eacute;chet manifolds and in particular a possible correlation between unbounded sectional curvatures and vanishing Riemannian distances. Fr√©chet manifolds represent a good compromise between very general (locally convex) and too restrictive (Banach/Hilbert) frameworks, with both abundance of meaningful examples and good (categorical) properties of smooth functions. Here are the <a href="slidemagistrale.pdf">slides</a> of my dissertation.</p>

		<p>In my Bachelor's thesis (under prof. Riccardo Benedetti) I learnt how Stiefel-Whitney classes provide estimates on the smallest <math><mi>n</mi></math> required to immerse compact manifolds into &#8477;<sup>n</sup>; in particular, a uniform lower bound for k-dimensional manifolds is given by the number of 1s in the dyadic expansion of k! (exclamation point, not factorial). Again you can find the <a href="slide.pdf">slides</a> of my dissertation.</p>

	<h3>When you think you are not good enough</h3>
	<p>Here is a true story that happened long time ago during a PhD examination at Princeton. Solomon Lefschetz, arguably a top mathematician, was in the committee. At one point the student was asked to prove the Picard-Lefschetz formula. Yes, the same Lefschetz. The student got stuck and had the "audacity" to ask Lefschetz to "unstuck" him. Lefschetz got stuck too. (It is a slick result.) The student passed the exam. [from a Quora answer by Liviu Nicolaescu]</p>
